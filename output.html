The soundtrack received mostly positive reviews. &#x27;&#x27;Tracksounds&#x27;&#x27;s review was again mixed, describing the score as  
little more than adequate. Noting a lack of thematic development or dramatic momentum, the reviewer nonetheless    
appreciated the score&#x27;s more <span class="r1">subdued moments, which he considered less forced than the rest of the track.</span>
